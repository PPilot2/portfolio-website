# How I Built My Portfolio: A Step-by-Step Journey  


**Building a portfolio is one of the best ways to showcase your skills, projects, and professional growth.** Whether you're a developer, designer, writer, or any other creative professional, a well-crafted portfolio can make a lasting impression. Hereâ€™s how I built mineâ€”from planning to deployment.

## **1. Planning & Goal Setting**  


Before diving into coding or design, I asked myself:  
- **Who is my target audience?** (Recruiters, clients, peers)  
- **What do I want to highlight?** (Projects, skills, resume, blog)  
- **Whatâ€™s my personal brand?** (Minimalist, bold, interactive)  


I sketched a basic layout on paper and listed must-have sections:  
âœ… **Homepage** (Hero section + quick intro)  
âœ… **Projects** (With descriptions and links)  
âœ… **About Me** (Bio, skills, and experience)  
âœ… **Contact** (Email, social links)

## **2. Choosing the Right Tech Stack**  


Since I wanted full control over customization, I decided against website builders like Wix or Squarespace. Instead, I went with:  


- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React for interactivity)  
- **Hosting:** Vercel (for fast deployment)  
- **Version Control:** GitHub (to track changes)  


*Optional Add-ons:*  
- **CMS** (Sanity.io or Netlify CMS for blog integration)  
- **Animations** (Framer Motion or GSAP for smooth transitions)

## **3. Designing for Impact**  


A portfolio should reflect personality while being user-friendly. My design principles:  
- **Clean & Responsive** â€“ Works on mobile and desktop  
- **Consistent Typography** â€“ Used Google Fonts (Inter + Montserrat)  
- **Color Scheme** â€“ Limited palette (primary + accent colors)  
- **Whitespace** â€“ Avoided clutter for better readability  


I used **Figma** to create wireframes and iterate before coding.

## **4. Development Process**  


### **Step 1: Setting Up the Structure**  
- Created a basic HTML skeleton  
- Added meta tags for SEO  
- Structured sections with semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`)  


### **Step 2: Styling with CSS**  
- Used **Flexbox & Grid** for layouts  
- Implemented **CSS variables** for easy theming  
- Added **media queries** for responsiveness  


### **Step 3: Adding Interactivity**  
- Built a dark/light mode toggle  
- Added smooth scrolling for navigation  
- Integrated a project filter (for categorizing work)  


### **Step 4: Optimizing Performance**  
- Compressed images with **ImageOptim**  
- Lazy-loaded offscreen content  
- Minified CSS/JS

## **5. Deployment & Going Live**  


I pushed my code to **GitHub** and deployed via **Vercel** (free for personal projects). For a custom domain, I bought one via Namecheap and connected it.  


**Final Checks Before Launch:**  
âœ” Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)  
âœ” Checked Lighthouse scores (aimed for 90+ on Performance, SEO, Accessibility)  
âœ” Asked friends for feedback

## **6. What I Learned**  


- **Start simple** â€“ Itâ€™s easy to overcomplicate; focus on core content first.  
- **Iterate often** â€“ My portfolio went through multiple redesigns.  
- **Showcase personality** â€“ A little flair (like a fun 404 page) makes it memorable.
